The code for "UniDSeg: Unified Cross-Domain 3D Semantic Segmentation via Visual Foundation Models Prior".

Due to other busy work, we are uploading an unorganized version for readers. This version lacks modules such as the VFM modules and proper naming conventions. We will work to perfect these aspects of the project as soon as possible. If you encounter any issues with this work, don't hesitate to contact us and give suggestions, and we will do our best to resolve them.
